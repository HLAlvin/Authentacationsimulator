So, I am Alvin. I won't really pull out my last name because I'm worried you'd try to get my address. I am working on this, since one of my dream jobs is to be a Game Dev. I won't give out my age, due to pedos on the internet. Why I am secure on the internet, is obviously my address, and Pedos. Your Address is also known as your IP. Though, I know games take alot of coding/effort to be considered as a real game. Like YandereDev was stupid enough. But then he decided that he should add some dedication/effort into his game. That led him to negativity, confusion, money based rumors, etc. And I was lazy. Part of myself has told me, "YandereDev is kinda lazy at times. You know, he spends the last 3 to 5 hours streaming on twitch, but he's rushing himself to work on Yandere Simulator." That is the reason, why I didn't want to end up like him. I was a dumb, kid. At the age, 12, I played ROBLOX, and decided to try to make a game. I knew I was bad at coding. So I put in, "A low quality Who's That quiz game." I wasn't good at making Models, uncreative questions, etc. Real coding is way harder than ROBLOX Coding. This had come to laziness on my game. I gave up temporarily. So I wanted to have a challenge to making a Simulator. Authentication. Authentication is the process how you're safe, in public, and online. It's also the process of helping the FireWall. That makes people sometimes try to hack the FireWall. Hackers includes Scammers. So I wanted to make this Simulator.
